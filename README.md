# epitech-dump-for-everyone

If you wish to install the dump on a dnf-based distro (i.e. Fedora), head over to https://github.com/Epitech/dump.

You've always wanted to install the Epitech dump on a non-dnf-based distro, but you're too lazy to install the packages? That script is the solution!

## How to install?

```shell
./install
```

## Tested on

### `apt-based`
##### Pop!_OS

### `pacman-based`
##### Arch linux, Manjaro
